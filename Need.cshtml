                <h2>More Info</h2>
                <p>My name is Josh Smith.  I am in need to stay at someone's house this Thanksgiving.
                   I will make sure that I clean up after myself and try not to bother anyone.
                   I'll even live in your basement all week if you don't want the rest of your
                   family to see me.  It's okay, I know how to hide in basements - I've been doing
                   it since I was 18.</p>
